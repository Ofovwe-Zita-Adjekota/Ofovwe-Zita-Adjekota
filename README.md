- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ofovwe-Zita-Adjekota
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tableau and part of SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analytics using Excel, Power BI, and SQL 
- 📫 Please reach me on my email: adjekotaroz@yahoo.com
- I would say that I have come a long way, beginning as a self-taught in SQL and then proceeding to attend a bootcamp and becoming certified today.
- My work might look like a child's play now, but hey, we have to start somewhere.
- My aim is to be called a Data Analyst and make my living as one.
